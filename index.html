        <h2>Why is it like this?</h2>
        <p>
          Websites are extremely complicated to build these days. We've gotten
          to the point where most web developers have
          <a href="https://nextjs.org/">layers of abstraction</a> on top of
          <a href="https://react.dev/">layers of abstraction</a> on top of the
          actual technology that's used.
        </p>
        <p>And as a web developer myself, I use these layers every day.</p>
        <p>
          These layers are useful for building powerful tools, social media,
          games, entertainment platforms, and so on - but in my opinion it's
          unnecessary for a simple personal website.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then one day I had to create a modern website from scratch, with no
          access to frameworks or modern tooling. And it was surprisingly
          capable.
        </p>
        <p>It was then that I realised we've overcomplicated things.</p>
        <p>
          I have always wanted a blog, but never could decide on the right
          framework. Do I use
          <a href="https://www.mkdocs.org/">MkDocs</a>?
          <a href="https://wordpress.com/">Wordpress</a>?
          <a href="https://svelte.dev/">Something custom</a>? Whatever I choose,
          I'm locked into it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Instead, I'm using this site make a point:
          <b>It doesn't have to be complicated.</b>
          You don't need to write prose in
          <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/">markdown</a> and compile it
          into a site. HTML was built for creating web pages - and it's
          perfectly suitable.
        </p>
        <p>
          The final piece of inspiration came from
          <a href="http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com/"
            >this somewhat rude website</a
          >, which shows just how little CSS is required to make a plain HTML
          document significantly more reader-friendly.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you don't like the look of this site, I don't blame you. Feel free
          to
          <a href="https://github.com/openstyles/stylus"
            >install an extension</a
          >
          and add your own styles to your liking. You'll find that there isn't
          much to override.
