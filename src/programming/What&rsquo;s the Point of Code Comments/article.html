<h2>What&rsquo;s the Point of Comments?</h2>
<p>
  I mean this question geniuinely - where do code comments fit in these days?
</p>
<p>
  If you think about it, we&rsquo;ve had comments as programmers since very
  early on. And back in the day, they were crucial. We were often limited in how
  many characters we could make our variable and function names, so we had to
  explain our code through comments.
</p>
<p>
  Today, we have the freedom to name our variables (almost) anything we like, so
  we can end up with nuggets of brilliance such as
  <code>userManagerConfigFactoryV2</code>. Fantastic&hellip; Regardless, through
  naming our variables well, we can help clarify its purpose.
</p>

<h3>Comments considered harmful?</h3>

<p>
  So we don&rsquo;t <em>need</em> comments, but what&rsquo;s the harm in
  including them? Well, sometimes comments can actually
  <em>cause</em> confusion. Here&rsquo;s a hypothetical.
</p>
<p>
  You leave a comment on a piece of code. Naturally, it&rsquo;s an excellent
  comment which is beautifully written and elegantly explains why the code is
  doing what it&rsquo;s doing. It&rsquo;s probably even got a diagram because
  you&rsquo;re such a rockstar.
</p>
<p>
  Some months later, your coworker (or future self) is doing a large refactor.
  They&rsquo;re using refactoring tools to perform this change, and verifying
  their work isn&rsquo;t breaking anything thanks to your codebase&rsquo;s tests
  (as they should).
</p>
<p>
  Unknown to them, they&rsquo;ve just subtly changed the code under your
  comment, and now the flow is slightly different. It produces identical results
  (thanks to the refactor), but your excellent comment is now talking nonsense.
</p>
<p>
  Congratulations! Your comment is now out-of-sync with your code, and nobody
  noticed!
</p>

<h3>So I should Avoid Comments?</h3>

<p>
  Let me first state the obvious here: the people reading your code (and your
  comments) are likely to be programmers. And as programmers, they&rsquo;re very
  good at reading and understanding what code does - especially if it&rsquo;s
  well structured. And <b>code doesn&rsquo;t lie</b>.
</p>
<p>
  Now, you&rsquo;re probably expecting me to say something along the lines of
</p>
<q
  >If you structure your code properly, and name your functions and variables
  well, you don&rsquo;t need comments at all!</q
>
<p>
  And&hellip; sure&hellip; That&rsquo;s one way to go. And this seems to be the
  opinion of quite a few people. But it&rsquo;s not very realistic.
</p>
<p>
  You&rsquo;re also almost certainly going to come across code that just cannot
  be explained without a comment. Especially if the code needs to be performant.
</p>
<p>
  And, to re-use the one joke in our field;
  <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TwoHardThings.html"
    >there are two hard things in computer science</a
  >:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Cache invalidation</li>
  <li>Naming things</li>
  <li>Off-by-one errors</li>
</ol>
<p>
  With good tooling, we can avoid the first and last one. Unfortunately, naming
  things well may always be a problem for humans (though I&rsquo;ve seen people
  attempt to tool their way around this with generative AI - not with much
  luck).
</p>

<h3>What About Documentation?</h3>

<p>
  Documenting your code with special comments (docstrings, javadoc, jsdoc, etc.)
  is a great way of keeping your documentation in-sync with your code (for the
  most part). And if you need documentation, I think this is your best option.
</p>
<p>
  One honourable mention in this space is the use of
  <a
    href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustdoc/write-documentation/documentation-tests.html"
    >testable examples</a
  >
  <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html"
    >in your documentation</a
  >. These can remind developers to update the documentation when they change
  the code - although ideally your interface doesn&rsquo;t change that much.
</p>

<h3>Verdict</h3>
<p>
  I&rsquo;m afraid this is going to be one of those wishy-washy &ldquo;we should
  all learn to get along&rdquo; type answers. Comments aren&rsquo;t really going
  anywhere, and they&rsquo;re still necessary in a large number of cases. At the
  same time, they are often overused by newer developers, and under-used by more
  experienced developers.
</p>
<p>
  Perhaps all I can offer is this advice:
  <b>prefer explaining your code with the code, instead of a comment</b>.
</p>
