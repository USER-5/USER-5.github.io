<h2>We Don&rsquo;t Need Documentation</h2>

<p>
  <i>&hellip;we don&rsquo;t need no source control</i>
</p>
<p>Couldn&rsquo;t help myself - it&rsquo;s a good earworm.</p>
<p>
  Let&rsquo;s be honest; documentation is something that not many people like to
  write. Even I, as someone who is <em>voluntarily</em> writing about
  programming right now, don&rsquo;t like writing documentation most of the
  time. I recently had a discussion about documentation - where and why
  it&rsquo;s important - and thought I&rsquo;d turn it into a full article.
</p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
  The holy text for software project managers in the 21st century is arguably
  <a href="https://agilemanifesto.org/">the agile manifesto</a>. And don&rsquo;t
  get me wrong; it&rsquo;s been a wonderful thing for coders and leaders alike.
</p>
<p><em>But</em> you only need to get to the 2nd value to find this:</p>
<q><strong>Working software</strong> over comprehensive documentation</q>
<p>
  Now I think this is a good value, and it encourages you to write readable
  code. The values are also explicitly intended to be
  <strong>preferences</strong>, not rules. But there&rsquo;s a tendancy to use
  this as an excuse to write little-to-no documentation.
</p>

<h3>Make yourself redundant</h3>
<p>No, really.</p>
<p>
  You should work to make yourself redundant. If you&rsquo;re a good developer,
  there will always be new challenges awaiting you.
</p>
<p>
  This means leaving information for the poor souls who have to pick up on your
  past work. If you don&rsquo;t - they will be contacting you endlessly, pulling
  you away from that shiny new project that you finally got to start.
</p>

<h3>Code never lies, but it can take a long time to get to the point</h3>
<p>
  As a developer, we are used to reading code in order to understand how it
  works. And the beautiful thing about code is that it doesn&rsquo;t lie about
  what it does.
</p>
<p>
  Unfortunately, that doesn&rsquo;t mean that it&rsquo;s very efficient at
  telling you what it&rsquo;s doing at a larger scale. And let&rsquo;s face it -
  not everyone can write readable code in the first place.
</p>
<p>
  Documentation provides us a way of explaining code that frees us from the
  codebase itself. We can use diagrams to map out systems, and stories and
  analogies to reason about decisions.
</p>

<h3>Documentation should deliver value</h3>
<p>
  Some people will say you should <q>document everything</q>, and that&rsquo;s
  one option. Perhaps we&rsquo;ll keep that idea just over here next to the bin
  in case we need it later&hellip;
</p>
<p>
  In my opinion, your guiding star should be
  <strong>document things that will be useful later</strong>. Which seems
  obvious, but can often help weed out unnecessary wiki pages and busywork.
</p>
<p>
  In addition to this - your entire process for documentation should focus on
  delivering value. If what you&rsquo;re writing will never be read - then
  there&rsquo;s no point. If your documentation templates are so dense that
  no-one ever creates a page - then you&rsquo;re shooting yourself in the foot.
  If your wiki is guarded by reviewers who pick up on every typo - then&hellip;
  you get the idea.
</p>

<h3>Explaining a picture is worth like a thousand pictures</h3>
<p>
  There&rsquo;s few things more disheartening than someone droping a link to a
  wiki article and saying <q>It&rsquo;s in here - have a read</q>.
</p>
<p>
  Your documentation should stand on its own, yes. But it&rsquo;s way easier to
  learn when you have the author helping explain it to you. This is also a good
  opportunity to find gaps in the explanation.
