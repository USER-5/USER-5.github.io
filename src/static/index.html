        <h2>Why is it like this?</h2>
        <p>
          Websites are extremely complicated to build these days. We&rsquo;ve gotten
          to the point where most web developers have
          <a href="https://nextjs.org/">layers of abstraction</a> on top of
          <a href="https://react.dev/">layers of abstraction</a> on top of the
          actual technology that&rsquo;s used.
        </p>
        <p>
          These layers are useful for building powerful tools, social media,
          games, entertainment platforms, and so on. And as a web developer
          myself, I use these layers every day.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then one day I had to create a modern website from scratch, with no
          access to frameworks or modern tooling. And it was surprisingly
          capable.
        </p>
        <p>It was then that I realised we&rsquo;ve overcomplicated things.</p>
        <p>
          I have always wanted a blog, but never could decide on the right
          framework. Do I use
          <a href="https://www.mkdocs.org/">MkDocs</a>?
          <a href="https://wordpress.com/">Wordpress</a>?
          <a href="https://svelte.dev/">Something custom</a>? Whatever I choose,
          I&rsquo;m locked into it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Instead, I&rsquo;m using this site make a point:
          <b>It doesn&rsquo;t have to be complicated.</b>
          You don&rsquo;t need to write prose in
          <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/">markdown</a> and compile it
          into a site. HTML was built for creating web pages - and it&rsquo;s
          perfectly suitable.
        </p>
        <p>
          The final piece of inspiration came from
          <a href="http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com/"
            >this somewhat rude website</a
          >, which shows just how little CSS is required to make a plain HTML
          document significantly more reader-friendly.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you don&rsquo;t like the look of this site, I don&rsquo;t blame you. Feel free
          to
          <a href="https://github.com/openstyles/stylus"
            >install an extension</a
          >
          and add your own styles to your liking. You&rsquo;ll find that there isn&rsquo;t
          much to override.
